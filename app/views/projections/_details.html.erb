<strong>This project was first launched by <%= link_to "Jay Pinho", "https://twitter.com/jaypinho", :target => "_blank" %>
in August 2015.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p/>
The <%= link_to "Federal Open Market Committee", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm", :target => "_blank" %>
first began releasing interest rate projections following its January 2012 meetings. These predictions of the
<%= link_to "federal funds rate", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm", :target => "_blank" %>,
"the interest rate at which depository institutions lend balances at the Federal Reserve to other depository institutions overnight,"
were designed to increase the Federal Reserve's transparency and to help align market expectations on future monetary policy.
<p/>
That first year, the Federal Reserve projected future interest rates on five separate occasions. Every year since,
it has followed a quarterly schedule: four projections are released annually.
<p/>
In <%= link_to "the FOMC's words", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20150617.htm", :target => "_blank" %>,
each of these projections represents:
<blockquote>
  ...an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate
  or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year
  or over the longer run.
</blockquote>
Since the FOMC began projecting future interest rates, FOMC participants have issued <%= number_with_delimiter(Projection.count) %>
individual projections. That is, if today Jay Powell projects that the "appropriate target level" for the federal funds rate at
the end of <%= Date.today.strftime('%Y') %> is 2.00%, that would count as one projection.
<p/>
The first chart above portrays the average projection of long-run interest rates for each date on which projections were made. For example,
in the December 15, 2021 meeting, the average FOMC projection of the federal funds rate was 2.46%.
<p/>
The second chart above displays all projected and actual rates over time since the Federal Reserve began issusing projections in early 2012.
The third chart displays every individual projection made since the Federal Reserve began issuing them, with the exception of
projections for dates in the future: that is, beyond <strong><%= Time.use_zone('America/New_York') { Time.zone.now.strftime("%B %e, %Y") } %></strong>. The x-axis displays
the number of days between the projection and its expiration. That is, to reuse the above example, a Jay Powell projection today of
the interest rate on the last day of <%= Date.today.strftime('%Y') %> would show up as <strong>-<%= (Date.new(Date.today.strftime('%Y').to_i,12,31) - Date.today).to_i %></strong> on the
x-axis. (The negative sign is because the projection occurs <em>before</em> the date for which the rate is being projected.)
<p/>
The y-axis, meanwhile, displays the differential between the projected rate and the actual rate on that day for each individual
projection. Actual daily federal funds rates are

<p/>
Finally, the outliers dropdown, located above the charts, allows users to remove the highest and lowest projections for all combinations of projection dates. For example, a selection of 2 would eliminate a total of 4 rates (2 each from the top and bottom) from the September 2021 projections for the end of 2021, as well as 4 rates from the September 2021 projections for
the end of 2022, and so on.
